- **Exterior Lights**: Intelligently manages exterior lights based on the time of day.
- **Interior Lights**: Provides automated control of interior lights in sync with the time of day.
- More features are in development and will be available soon.

### **Notice**
#### This program is not intended for manual light control.

Please be aware that msfs-auto-lights is not designed for manual light control. It does not allow manual toggling of lights.
